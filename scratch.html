    <p><h3>My Travel Story</h3>
    Ever since I was young, my parents wanted us to be able to travel so we could experience the world around us, and know that there's something much bigger than us out there.
    This started with local camping trips, then it grew to family road trips a few states over, to then flying across the country to go to unvisited states and National Parks.
    So, by the time I was 18, I had visited every state in the U.S.
    I am so grateful I have been fortunate enough to see the beautiful country I get to live in and the many different cultures within.
    My wonderful parents also not only believed in just visiting the state for tourist attractions.
    They had a goal to visit historical sites, National Parks, museums, and other culturally and historically significant areas of the US so we could learn while we had fun traveling.
